## Krypton Tokens
Krypton Token is the mechanism for safekeeping our secrets in plain sight like those Bitcoin accounts published on the Bitcoin Blockchain, which are visible to anyone without revealing their owner. It is in fact much stronger than Bitcoin in the sense that its content is completely shielded (encrypted) from prying eyes and its "transaction" history is not recorded, in addition to its anonymity. Ai-Fi.net keeps an extremely low profile in providing this style of cloud storage as long as the fee is paid (not yet integrated). It takes advantage of the "account-less" property of Ai-Fi service in implementing this over the counter, pay-as-you-go, cash-only cloud storage for many "hot potato" issues like the storing of your passwords, secret key pairs, certificates, digital assets, crypto accounts, etc.
